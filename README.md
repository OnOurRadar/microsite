# **Pre-launch Requirements**

Ahead of the site launch, you will need a domain (paid) with WordPress (free) installed.

We recommend looking for a domain with Wordpress Hosting through GoDaddy - through the portal here

[https://uk.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting](https://uk.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting).

Once you are set up and can access your dashboard, please follow the instructions below.

**For users with an exiting site, please export all post and page data via the exporter, as the new site will _overwrite_ existing data for the domain.**

# **Installing the site**

Download a migration plugin [**here**](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/all-in-one-wp-migration.6.77.zip) and install it by uploading it in the Plugins section of the Dashboard.

Either use the wpress file from this repository or download the import file for the site [**here**](https://talk-kit.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/accessible-microsite.local-20210901-223653-620.wpress).

With the migration plug-in installed, you can start the import process to install the site.

Follow the notes, overwrite the current site, and update the permalink **twice** to the site when prompted.

Following this, the site will now be live with the default settings. You will be logged out and will need to use the credentials below to access the site.

**Site Icon / Favicon**

The site icon can be added through the Favicon tab in Settings. You will need a image roughly 200px wide for the icon. Once uploaded, the icon will be added to your pages.

# Publishing Content for the site

**Importing Existing Data**

If you have existing data from a previous WordPress site, you can upload the posts via the Import feature on the Dashboard

**Pages**

The site provides support for four main pages - About us, Reports, Reporters, and Contact Us. These can all be updated in the Pages section of the Dashboard.

Like posts, pages can be edited using the text editor, with links, images and videos added.

For new pages, please use the Empty Page template in Page Attributes for a blank template to fill with content.

Once created, these can be added to the Primary and Secondary Menus in the Menu Tab.

**Posts**

New posts can be added via the Posts section of the Dashboard. They will require a Title, Summary, Featured Image, Reporter. Posts also require Categories and Tags (see the section below).

**Reporters**

Reporters are a special content type for the theme. They require a Title, Summary, Featured Image, and background image. In addition, you can add tags and icons to make certain users stand out - for example - community leads.

**Categories &amp; Tags**

Categories should be used to separate content types for your posts - for example, video or audio reports.

Tags can be used more generally, with multiple tags added to each post. We recommend adding a maximum of 10 tags for each post, with consistency across the site so visitors can easily search using the tag cloud on the main page.
